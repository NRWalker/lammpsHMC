# lammpsHMC

Description
===========
 
This is a set of programs used for classifying samples of materials across a range of temperatures as solid or liquid for the purpose of estimating the melting point. The smaples are generated by performing isobaric-isothermal Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulations using the LAMMPS simulation package within python.

Requirements
============

Python
------

- LAMMPS
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Joblib
- Scikit-Learn
- Lasagne
- Scikit-NeuralNetwork
- MatPlotLib
- PIL

LAMMPS Libraries
----------------

- USER-MEAMC (for MEAM potentials)
- PYTHON

File Descriptions
=================

lammps_hmc.py
-------------

This program interfaces with LAMMPS to produce thermodynamic information and trajectories from NPT-HMC simulations. LAMMPS is used to constuct the system and run the dynamics. The Monte Carlo moves are performed in Python.

lammps_parse.py
---------------

This program parses the output from lammps_hmc.py and pickles the data.

lammps_rdf.py
-------------

This program calculates the radial distributions and structure factors for each sample using the pickled trajectory information from lammps_parse.py. The radial distributions are performed in parallel and the structure factors are calculated as Fourier transitions of the radial distributions. The script pickles the data, which also includes density information.

lammps_neural.py
----------------

This program classifies samples as either solids or liquids by passing either the radial distributions or the structure factors through a neural network. There are many options available with regards to which data scaler, classification neural network, and fitting function to use in addition to whether data reduction/transformation should be used.

Further Development
===================

Some more advanced Monte Carlo methods may be implemented to improve sampling in addition to more robust machine learning analysis.
